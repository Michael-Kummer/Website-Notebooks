# Website Projects

All the code from my website projects are here.

My current projects are below:

#### Senior Fraud:
- This is a final Buisness Economics class project that will later be submitted to the SOA for an essay competition.
- Focuses on Canada fraud data and retirement insurance.
- In the early stages. will be completed by EOM April.


#### Volunteerism in Alberta:
- This project mainly focuses on my volunteer coordination experience. Currently Alberta has an issue of reengaging senior volunteers. This has ripple effects across many industries, and negatively impacts families that rely on local charities.
- Fairly close to finished. Will be finished March.
